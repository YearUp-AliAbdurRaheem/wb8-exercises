## Log4J
In [`Main.java`](src/main/java/com/pluralsight/Main.java) you will find an example/test for `Logging` with `Log4J`.
The [`pom.xml`](pom.xml) file has dependencies for `Log4J`. 
It has a dependency manager with a **BOM** (Bill Of Materials), 
that makes sure the versions are consistent and that you only have to type the version number once; for example: `2.24.2`.
